# Agent Stream Status
#
# Response from polling the agent streaming session.
# Flutter calls pollAgentStream() every 500ms and receives
# all events collected so far, plus the session status.
#
# Flow:
# 1. Flutter calls startAgentConverse() → gets sessionId
# 2. Flutter polls pollAgentStream(sessionId) every 500ms
# 3. Each poll returns new events + status
# 4. When status == 'complete', final response is included
# 5. Flutter stops polling and displays final state
